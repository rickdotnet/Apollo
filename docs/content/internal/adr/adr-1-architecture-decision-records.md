# ADR-1 - Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context

To better understand the decisions made throughout the project, we need a system to document them. The system should enable:

- **Knowledge Sharing** - Onboard new contributors faster by providing quick context.
- **Historical Context** - Offer a better understanding of trade-offs and why certain choices were made.
- **Collaboration** - Integrating via pull requests allows additional collaboration.

## Decision

This project will use an Architecture Decision Records (`ADR`) system to document technical and architectural decisions and a Knowledge Base (`KB`) for non-decision content.

**Details**
- Written in Markdown format.
- ADRs
  - lives in `content/internal/adr`.
  - Sections
    - A `Status` field (e.g., `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded`, `Deprecated`) will track the state of the decision.
    - A `Context` section will provide the background and rationale for the decision.
    - A `Decision` section will outline the decision itself.
  - Updated or superseded ADRs should reference relevant ADR(s).
- Knowledge Base (KB) articles (non-decision content, tutorials, etc.)
  - lives in `content/internal/kb`.

**Updates**
- Changes to ADRs should be made via explicit `git` commit or pull request
- When additional conversation is needed, updates should be made via pull requests

**ADR File Naming**
- `ADR-#-slug.md` (e.g., `ADR-1-architecture-decision-records.md`).
