# Introduction

Internal Documents are meant to capture key knowledge and provide insight into the project’s technical and architectural decisions.

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - a running log of technical and architectural decisions.
- **Knowledge Base (KB)** - context that doesn’t warrant an ADR but might support them.

These docs are living resources and evolve alongside the project.
