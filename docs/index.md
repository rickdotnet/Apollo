## Apollo

Apollo aims to be a lightweight, high-performance messaging client designed to provide developers with a simple yet powerful way to incorporate flexible architectures into their .NET applications. Initially built on top of the NATS messaging system, Apollo now also supports Azure Service Bus, offering even more flexibility for your messaging needs. With Apollo, you can easily handle events, commands, and requests with minimal configuration, while benefiting from the speed and scalability of NATS and the reliability of Azure Service Bus.

## RAPID DEVELOPMENT

Apollo is under rapid development. Feel free to pitch in! Join the fun at [discord.gg/rick](https://discord.gg/rick).

## Vision

The goal for this library is to provide a solid foundation, of which to build upon. The library should be easy to use, and provide a simple API for developers to work with. The library should be flexible, and allow developers to swap out the underlying messaging system with minimal effort.

And that's it. Keep it simple, and keep it flexible.

## More to come

More documentation and examples are on the way. Stay tuned!
